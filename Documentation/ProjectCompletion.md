# LED Messenger v2 Project Completion

## Project Overview

LED Messenger v2 is a complete rewrite and significant upgrade from the original legacy application. The project implements a professional-grade macOS and iOS application for controlling messages displayed on LED walls through the OSC protocol.

## Completion Summary

All planned phases and tasks of the LED Messenger v2 project have been successfully completed:

- **Phase 1**: Foundation and Core Services
- **Phase 2**: macOS Application Development
- **Phase 3**: iPad Application - Solo Mode
- **Phase 4**: iPad Application - Paired Mode
- **Phase 5**: Integration and Testing

The application now provides a fully functional, production-ready solution for managing LED wall messaging in professional settings.
